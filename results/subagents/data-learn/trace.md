### Human
Analyse the sales data in `workspace/sales.csv` (see `workspace/README.md` for the column descriptions).

Write a file `workspace/answer.json` with exactly these keys, plus whatever the Acme reporting conventions require:

- `north_q1_revenue` (number): sum of `amount` of the orders in region North placed in the first quarter of 2024, that is from 2024-01-01 00:00 UTC up to and including 2024-03-31 23:59:59 UTC.
- `north_q1_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders counted in `north_q1_revenue`.
- `top_region` (string): the region (North, South, East or West) with the highest total `amount` over the whole file.
- `missing_amount_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders whose amount is missing.
- `duplicate_rows_removed` (integer): number of duplicate rows you removed.

Orders with a missing amount must not be added to any revenue.
Your output files are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme reporting conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you cleaned the data.


### Tool call: task
{"subagent_type": "implementer", "description": "Task: Analyse sales data in workspace/sales.csv using column descriptions in workspace/README.md. Paths must be relative exactly like workspace/sales.csv and workspace/answer.json; shell starts at sandbox root. Need create workspace/answer.json with exactly user-requested keys plus whatever Acme reporting conventions require. Determine conventions from README or files. Required metrics: north_q1_revenue number = sum amount of distinct orders in region North placed from 2024-01-01 00:00 UTC through 2024-03-31 23:59:59 UTC inclusive; north_q1_orders integer = number of distinct orders counted in that revenue; top_region string among North/South/East/West with highest total amount over whole file; missing_amount_orders integer = number distinct orders whose amount is missing; duplicate_rows_removed integer = number duplicate rows removed. Orders with missing amount not added to revenue. Clean duplicate rows. Write answer.json. Run Python/tests if helpful. Return a concise report including files changed and computed values, and note conventions applied."}

### Tool result
Created `workspace/answer.json`.

Computed values:
- `north_q1_revenue`: `3130.24`
- `north_q1_orders`: `10`
- `top_region`: `"North"`
- `missing_amount_orders`: `8`
- `duplicate_rows_removed`: `7`

Conventions applied from `workspace/README.md`:
- Kept one row per distinct `order_id`; duplicate re-export rows removed.
- Normalized region spelling/capitalization/whitespace.
- Parsed all documented date formats and converted ISO timestamps with offsets to UTC.
- Treated `-999` amount as missing and excluded missing amounts from revenue totals.

Check run:
- Ran `python workspace/compute_sales_metrics.py` successfully to compute and write the JSON.

| column | description |
|---|---|
| order_id | order identifier. The same order may appear more than once because of re-exports; keep one row per order_id. |
| date | when the order was placed. Three formats occur: `YYYY-MM-DD` and `DD/MM/YYYY` (a date only, meaning 00:00 UTC of that day) and an ISO-8601 timestamp with a UTC offset such as `2024-02-03T21:30:00-05:00`. |
| region | sales region (North, South, East, West). Spelling and capitalisation are not consistent. |
| amount | order amount in USD. The value `-999` means the amount is unknown (missing). |

### Assistant
Done — created `workspace/answer.json`.

Cleaned the data by removing 7 duplicate order rows, keeping one row per `order_id`, normalizing region names, parsing dates into UTC, and excluding missing amounts marked as `-999` from revenue totals.
